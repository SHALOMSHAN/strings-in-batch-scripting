In batch scripting, strings can be assigned to variables and manipulated using various commands. For example, the `set` command can be used to assign a string value to a variable, and the `echo` command can be used to display the value of a string variable. Additionally, the `findstr` command can be used to search for a specific string within a text file, and the `replace` command can be used to replace a specific string with another string.
